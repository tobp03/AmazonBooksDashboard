## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   This will download any required dataset and process them into our intended formats. They may take a little while.
3. Afterwards, you may simply run this command to view the dashboard without doing data processing
   ```
   streamlit run dash1.py
   ```
